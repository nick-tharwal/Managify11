* Online learning came as a boon to the students who were unable to attend normal school due to the pandemic.
* But since there are two sides to a coin, the boon soon became a curse when students struggles to manage their deadlines , pdf-notes and also their attendeces.
* The digital devices became a part of our school life and it becomes hard to manage notes, to remind deadline and count the attendences.
* Most of the teachers put their Notes in whatsapp group , which become invisible after a certain more messeges.
* Google classroom can manage classroom for teacher but most of classrooms in country hardly uses it , but everyone Whatsapp.
* This inspire us to built Managify.

* It makes easy to upload your notes , assignments just by forwarding it to Whatsapp bot.
* Also mark your attendence through the same whatsapp bot.
* If want to see notes related to any of your subject or want to check the attendnce just ask the bot.
